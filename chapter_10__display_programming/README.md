# Chapter 10: Display programming {#chapter-10-display-programming}

Flash Player 9 and later, Adobe AIR 1.0 and later

Visual elements are programmed in Adobe® ActionScript® 3.0 by working with display objects on the display stage. For example, you can add, move, remove, and order display objects, apply filters and masks, draw vector and bitmap graphics, and perform three-dimensional transformations using the ActionScript display programming API. The primary classes used for display programming are part of the [flash.display package](http://help.adobe.com/en_US/FlashPlatform/reference/actionscript/3/flash/display/package-detail.html).

**_Note:_ **_Adobe_® _AIR_™ _provides the HTMLoader object for rendering and displaying HTML content. The HTMLLoader renders the visual elements of the HTML DOM as a single display object. You cannot access the individual elements of the DOM directly through the ActionScript display list hierarchy. Instead, you access these DOM elements using the separate DOM API provided by the HTMLLoader._
