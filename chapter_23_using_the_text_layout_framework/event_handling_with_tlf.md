## Event handling with TLF {#event-handling-with-tlf}

Flash Player 10 and later, Adobe AIR 1.5 and later

TextFlow objects dispatch events in many circumstances, including:

*   When the text or layout changes
*   Before an operation begins and after an operation completes
*   When the status of a FlowElement object changes
*   When a compose operation completes

For more information, see flashx.textLayout.events in the ActionScript 3.0 Reference for the Adobe Flash Platform.
