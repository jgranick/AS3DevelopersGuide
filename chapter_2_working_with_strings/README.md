The String class contains methods that let you work with text strings. Strings are important in working with many objects. The methods described here are useful for working with strings used in objects such as TextField, StaticText, XML, ContextMenu, and FileReference objects.

Strings are sequences of characters. ActionScript 3.0 supports ASCII and Unicode characters.
