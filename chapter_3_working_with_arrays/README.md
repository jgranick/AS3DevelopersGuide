# Chapter 3: Working with arrays {#chapter-3-working-with-arrays}

Flash Player 9 and later, Adobe AIR 1.0 and later

Arrays allow you to store multiple values in a single data structure. You can use simple indexed arrays that store values using fixed ordinal integer indexes or complex associative arrays that store values using arbitrary keys. Arrays can also be multidimensional, containing elements that are themselves arrays. Finally, you can use a Vector for an array whose elements are all instances of the same data type.
