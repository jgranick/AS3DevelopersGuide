## Localizing Flash content {#localizing-flash-content}

Flash Player 9 and later, Adobe AIR 1.0 and later

Adobe Flash Professional includes a Locale class in the ActionScript 3.0 components. The Locale class allows you to control how a SWF file displays multilanguage text. The Flash Strings panel allows you to use string IDs instead of string literals in dynamic text fields. This facility allows you to create a SWF file that displays text loaded from a language-specific XML file. For information on using the Locale class, see the [ActionScript 3.0 Reference for the Adobe](http://help.adobe.com/en_US/FlashPlatform/reference/actionscript/3/fl/lang/Locale.html) [Flash Platform](http://help.adobe.com/en_US/FlashPlatform/reference/actionscript/3/fl/lang/Locale.html).
