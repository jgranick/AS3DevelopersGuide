# Chapter 5: Using regular expressions {#chapter-5-using-regular-expressions}

Flash Player 9 and later, Adobe AIR 1.0 and later

A regular expression describes a pattern that is used to find and manipulate matching text in strings. Regular expressions resemble strings, but they can include special codes to describe patterns and repetition. For example, the following regular expression matches a string that starts with the character A followed by one or more sequential digits:

/A\d+/

The following topics describe the basic syntax for constructing regular expressions. However, regular expressions can have many complexities and nuances. You can find detailed resources on regular expressions on the web and in bookstores. Keep in mind that different programming environments implement regular expressions in different ways. ActionScript 3.0 implements regular expressions as defined in the ECMAScript edition 3 language specification (ECMA-262).
