# Chapter 65: How to Use ActionScript Examples {#chapter-65-how-to-use-actionscript-examples}

Running an ActionScript 3.0 code example is one of the best ways to learn how particular classes and methods work. You can use examples in different ways, depending on the devices you are using or targeting.

**Computers running Flash Professional or Flash Builder** See

“Running ActionScript 3.0 examples in Flash

Professional” on page 1098

or

“Running ActionScript 3.0 examples in Flash Builder” on page 1099

for information about how to use these development environments to run ActionScript 3.0 examples. Use trace statements and other debugging tools to increase your understanding of how a code example works.

**Mobile devices** You can run the ActionScript 3.0 code examples on mobile devices that support Flash Player 10.1 and later releases. See

“Running ActionScript 3.0 examples on mobile devices” on page 1100

. You can also run these examples on your computer using Flash Professional or Flash Builder.

**TV devices** Though you cannot run these examples on TV devices, you can still learn from the examples by running them on your computer. See [Flash Platform for TV](http://www.adobe.com/devnet/devices/flash_platform_tv.html) on the Adobe Developer Connection website for information about developing applications for TV devices.
