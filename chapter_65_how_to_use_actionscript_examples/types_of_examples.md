## Types of examples {#types-of-examples}

The types of ActionScript 3.0 code examples are:

*   Code snippet examples (found throughout the ActionScript 3.0 documentation set)
*   Class-based examples (found primarily in the [ActionScript 3.0 Language Reference](http://help.adobe.com/en_US/FlashPlatform/reference/actionscript/3/index.html))
*   Practical examples containing multiple source files (download source ZIP files from [www.adobe.com/go/learn_programmingAS3samples_flash](http://www.adobe.com/go/learn_programmingAS3samples_flash))

Code snippet examples

A code snippet example looks like this:

var x:int = 5; trace(x); // 5

Code snippets only contain enough code to demonstrate a single idea. They do not normally contain package or class statements.

Class-based examples

Many examples show the source code for a complete ActionScript class. A class-based example looks like this:

package {

public class Example1 {

public function Example1():void { var x:int = 5;

trace(x); //5

}

}

}

The code for a class-based example includes a package statement, a class declaration, and a constructor function.

Practical examples containing multiple source files

Many of the topics in the ActionScript 3.0 Developer’s Guide conclude with practical examples that show how to use certain ActionScript features in a practical, real-world context. These examples usually contain multiple files including:

*   One or more ActionScript source files
*   A .FLA file for use with Flash Professional
*   One or more MXML files for use with Flash Builder
*   Data files, image files, sound files, or other assets used by the example application (optional). Practical examples are normally delivered as ZIP archive files.
