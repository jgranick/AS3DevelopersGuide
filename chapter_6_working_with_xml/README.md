# Chapter 6: Working with XML {#chapter-6-working-with-xml}

Flash Player 9 and later, Adobe AIR 1.0 and later

ActionScript 3.0 includes a group of classes based on the ECMAScript for XML (E4X) specification (ECMA-357 edition 2). These classes include powerful and easy-to-use functionality for working with XML data. Using E4X, you will be able to develop code with XML data faster than was possible with previous programming techniques. As an added benefit, the code you produce will be easier to read.
