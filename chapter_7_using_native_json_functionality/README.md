# Chapter 7: Using native JSON functionality {#chapter-7-using-native-json-functionality}

ActionScript 3.0 provides a native API for encoding and decoding ActionScript objects using JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format. The JSON class and supporting member functions follow the ECMA-262 5th edition specification with few variances.

Community member Todd Anderson provides a comparison of the native JSON API and the third-party as3corelib JSON class. See [Working with Native JSON in Flash Player 11](http://blog.infrared5.com/2011/07/working-with-native-json-in-flash-player-11/).
